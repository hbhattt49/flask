Hey [Colleague's Name],

It’s hard to believe it’s time to say goodbye! We just wanted to let you know how much we’ve appreciated everything you brought to the team.

Your work on the virtual environment setup was a game changer—smooth, efficient, and super reliable. And the Rasa Chatbot? That was a whole new level of smart. You’ve always been the go-to person for innovative ideas, and your passion for exploring new tools really pushed us all to do better.

We’re genuinely going to miss your energy, creativity, and of course, your tech wizardry. Wishing you the best in whatever comes next—you’re going to do amazing things.

Stay in touch and don’t forget us!

Cheers,
[Your Name / Team Name]
