1. Instant Payments / UPI / Faster Payments Switch

Scenario

Container fronts APIs for UPI / IMPS / RTP / FedNow / SEPA Instant etc.

Same container handles: auth, posting, status, refunds, dispute lookups.


Friction-driven roles

Normal role – full features: balance hints, offers, spending insights, rich logging.

Surge role (high friction = queue depth/latency ↑)

Temporarily turn off non-essential APIs (spend insights, offers).

Reduce logging, disable expensive cross-system lookups.

Prioritize low-amount / critical bill payments first.


Risk-off role (fraud score or anomaly ↑ even if infra fine)

Tighten limits (amount/velocity), require extra auth factors.

Route suspicious payments to an async “review” queue.



Why this is powerful
One running container continuously mutates between normal / surge / risk-off personalities using the friction score, instead of needing separate deployments or manual “incident” runbooks.

2. Card Authorization & Merchant Acquiring Gateway

Scenario

Container is the card auth microservice for POS/e-com traffic.

It talks to scheme networks (Visa, Mastercard, RuPay, etc.), risk engine, ledger.


Friction-driven roles

Full-fidelity role – real-time risk models, geo-IP checks, 3DS, loyalty, etc.

Degraded but safe role (network latency ↑ or CPU ↑)

Use cheaper fallback model or rules engine when ML is overloaded.

Skip loyalty/offer enrichment but never skip mandatory compliance checks.


Business-priority role

When friction is high, prioritize VIP bins / critical merchants (fuel, health, utilities) over low-priority categories (non-essential retail).



Why this is powerful
Instead of failing authorizations when risk models are slow, the same container changes role to a “minimal safe decision engine” and keeps auth uptime & customer experience high.

3. Digital Channels: Mobile / Internet Banking Session Node

Scenario

Container serves online & mobile banking APIs: login, balances, statements, fund transfer, offers, dashboards.


Friction-driven roles

Experience-rich role – full dashboards, widgets, personalisation, marketing tiles.

Connectivity-constrained role (latency, packet loss ↑ or CPU ↑)

Turn into “lite mode” personality:

show only balances & essential payments,

collapse heavy dashboards / charts,

reduce image/content size and analytics calls.



Reg-first role (reg/reporting friction ↑, e.g., EOD close cut-off approaching)

Temporarily shift capacity from non-essential browsing (offers, history beyond X months) to important flows like KYC, dispute filing, mandate management.



Why this is powerful
Same pod can dynamically be “Experience pod”, “Lite pod”, or “Reg-first pod” based on friction, without blue-green or separate stacks.

4. Real-Time Fraud / Credit Decision Microservice

Scenario

Container hosts APIs for fraud checks or credit approval (cards, personal loans, BNPL).

It uses multiple models, 3rd-party data sources, and rules.


Friction-driven roles

High-accuracy role – multi-model ensemble, many external data calls, high CPU.

Fast-decision role (queue depth ↑, SLA breach risk)

Use simpler but conservative model (or scorecard) to avoid SLA penalties.

Approve only “very safe” applications, move marginal cases to async/manual review.


Degraded-external role (3rd-party bureaus or KYC providers slow/failing)

Swap personality to:

rely more on internal history / on-us data,

temporarily change limits and offer only lower-risk products.




Why this is powerful
Rather than an all-or-nothing risk system outage, the container adapts its “risk personality” at runtime to keep decisions flowing but bias toward safety.

5. Regulatory Reporting + EOD Batch vs. Live Traffic

Scenario

Container participates in EOD closing, reconciliations, regulatory & MIS reports.

The same infra also supports live transactional traffic (APIs, channels).


Friction-driven roles

Daytime live-traffic role – focuses on customer APIs, only light background jobs.

Pre-cut-off regulatory role (friction ↑ because reg deadlines are near or backlog of reports ↑)

Container changes to Reg-priority personality:

throttle non-critical channel features,

allocate more CPU/IO to EOD, reconciliations, regulatory extracts,

delay heavy, non-reg analytics/batch jobs.



Post-EOD cleanup role – after friction drops (reports done), personality flips back and uses spare capacity for historical analytics, backfills, ML feature builds.


Why this is powerful
Regulatory deadlines are hard; instead of over-provisioning separate clusters “just in case”, a single container can swing its role toward compliance when friction says it’s needed.
