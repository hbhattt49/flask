Subject: Request for External Monitor for Development Work

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to bring to your notice that the screen size of my current laptop is quite small, and I often need to work for long hours on coding and debugging tasks. This makes it difficult to view multiple windows, logs, and code files comfortably, and is also causing some strain on my eyes.

To improve productivity and work more efficiently, I request your approval for an external monitor to be used along with my laptop. This will help me manage my development work better and maintain a healthier working posture during long hours.

Kindly let me know if any additional details or formalities are required from my side.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Designation / Team]
