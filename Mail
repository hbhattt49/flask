I wanted to bring to your notice that the screen size of my current laptop is quite small, and I often need to work for long hours on coding and debugging tasks. This makes it difficult to view multiple windows, logs, and code files comfortably and is also causing strain on my eyes.

To work more efficiently and maintain a better posture during long hours, I request your approval for an external monitor to be used at my home workstation. This will help me set up a more productive and ergonomic environment while working from home, especially for development activities that require continuous focus.

The monitor will be used strictly for official work and can be recorded as a company asset as per policy. Please let me know if any further details or formalities are required from my side.

Thank you for your consideration.
