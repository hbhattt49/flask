The Simplified Investing 1.0 (PI4) project focuses on building a centralized reporting solution to track key business metrics related to Merrill Edge Self-Directed (MESD) account journeys. The objective is to provide the business with a Tableau dashboard powered by reliable, curated data sourced from Oracle and SDP systems, enabling visibility into client applications, submissions, account openings, funding, and digital channel usage (NBAA app).

Brief Project Summary


This project delivers an end-to-end analytics solution by creating a new base table in Oracle to consolidate multiple MESD-related metrics. The curated dataset serves as a single source of truth for a Tableau dashboard that helps stakeholders track application initiation, submission, account opening, funding, and SSO creation across different client segments (Bank-only, Existing clients with linked/unlinked accounts).
