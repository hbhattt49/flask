Subject: Request for Work from Home During Holi Week

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you are doing well. As Holi is approaching, I would like to request work from home during the Holi week ([mention specific dates]) to manage travel and family commitments while ensuring my work remains uninterrupted.

I will be fully available during work hours, attending meetings, responding to emails, and completing my tasks as per schedule. Please let me know if you need any adjustments or if there are any concerns.

Looking forward to your approval.

Best regards,
Pushpam Singh
