Below are 5 existing patents that sit near your space (autoscaling / container management) and how they differ from your “one smart container, many roles + friction score + ephemeral personality” idea.
1. Autoscaling applications in shared cloud resources – IBM (US 9,547,534 B2)
What it does (very high level)
A “tool” that registers trigger conditions (CPU, response time, etc.) and then scales applications up/down in a shared cloud resource environment.
Scaling = adding or removing resources/instances when thresholds are crossed.

How this is different from your idea
Focus is on changing the number/size of instances, not changing the behaviour/role of a single running container.
Uses conditions/thresholds to trigger autoscaling events, not to compute a composite “friction score” that drives role/personality mutation.
No concept of an ephemeral personality layer that can switch a container between “VIP mode / risk-off mode / batch mode” without restart.
2. Auto-scaling thresholds in elastic computing environments – IBM (US 10,360,123 B2)
What it does
Deals with how to set and adjust auto-scaling thresholds (upper/lower bounds for metrics) that trigger allocation or release of resources in elastic environments. 
https://patents.google.com/patent/US10360123
Difference vs yours
Again about tuning thresholds for scaling infrastructure, not changing application semantics inside one container.
Threshold logic is per metric (CPU, latency, etc.). Your idea fuses many signals + business priority into a single friction score and then mutates roles inside the same process.
No notion of mode-specific behaviours (e.g., degrade features, change risk rules) as a first-class construct.
3. Container based service management – IBM (US 10,691,504 B2)
What it does
Provides a way to migrate a service from one container to another while handling in-flight and waiting requests to reduce downtime. 
https://patents.justia.com/assignee/international-business-machine-corporation?page=863&utm_source=chatgpt.com
Difference vs yours
The main idea is moving a service between containers for management/migration.
Your invention keeps one container alive but changes its role/personality in-place based on friction and business rules.
This IBM patent is about service migration & continuity, not about dynamic role switching / multi-personality of a single instance.
4. Dynamic Container Resizing – IBM (US 2024/0320057 A1, application)
What it does
Uses telemetry and regression / time-series analysis to predict future resource usage of a container and then resize the container’s resources accordingly (CPU, memory). 
https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240320057?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Difference vs yours
Adjusts resource size of a container; logical behaviour of the app stays the same.
Your system keeps resources maybe constant but changes the functional role (API vs batch vs risk-off) and feature set based on friction.
Their decisions optimise resource utilisation; yours explicitly optimises business outcomes + resilience by switching personalities.
5. Multi-cluster container orchestration – IBM (US 11,861,405 B2)
What it does
A manager node collects metrics from many compute nodes; an orchestrator uses this to place/move containerised applications across clusters/nodes for multi-cluster orchestration. 
https://patents.google.com/patent/US11861405
Difference vs yours
Focus is where containers run (across clusters / nodes).
Your focus is how a given container behaves (role, risk posture, feature level) at runtime.
Their metrics drive placement & scaling, not internal personality / role mutation or a unified friction score.
Putting it together – what still looks unique in your concept
Based only on these public summaries (again: not legal advice, not exhaustive):
In-place role mutation
Existing work: scale, resize, migrate, or move containers.
Yours: keep one container alive and change its operational role (e.g., “Instant-payments VIP mode”, “Risk-off mode”, “Batch mode”) based on a real-time score.
Single composite “friction score” + business signals
Existing autoscaling patents use one or more metrics directly for scaling/thresholds.
You emphasise a single scalar friction index built from technical + business + risk inputs, which then drives role/personality switching.
Ephemeral personality layer
I haven’t seen patents using a named “personality layer” that attaches/detaches behaviour bundles (feature flags, risk rules, logging levels) dynamically to a container.
That “morning API / afternoon batch / night backup” personality idea is your differentiator.
Banking-specific prioritisation
These patents are mostly infrastructure-generic.
You explicitly tie friction + roles to banking business logic (VIP customers, regulatory cut-offs, fraud/risk modes), which strengthens the “technical effect in a specific domain”.
